### Hello! I'm Karina.

I'm studying \*sweats in idk\* at Harvard (except not really because physical Harvard isn't really happening right now).

Slow facts (that sink might be at your door if you want to let it in):

- Currently:
  - In all honesty, probably eating, sleeping, and/or watching TV, but occasionally I will take a break from those activities and do...
  - Research @\*gestures broadly at Harvard\*
  - Education @\*gestures broadly at Harvard once again\*

- Interests that would probably not make it on a resumé, even if it had an "interests" section: tag groups, music of the listening variety (Ava Max, Valerie Broussard, Amy Winehouse, Joe Hisaishi, and Sara Ramirez at the moment I'm typing this, but the Spotify recommendations can and will change that in about five minutes), FYP reels, Grey's Anatomy, political comedy
