### Hello! I'm Karina.

I'm studying \*sweats in idk\* at Harvard (except not really because physical Harvard isn't really happening right now).

Slow facts (that sink might be at your door if you want to let it in):

- Currently (not literally at this minute because I'm probably sleeping or watching TV, and most definitely not all at the same time, but think more along the lines of this day/month):
  - NLP research @\*gestures broadly at Harvard\*
  - Curriculum @\*gestures broadly at Harvard once again\*

- Interests that would probably make it on a resumé if my resumé had an "interests" section: computational linguistics, language x culture x education x power x history, law, public policy, arts (dance and music of the playing variety), justice (indecisive? Yes. And?)
- Interests that would probably not make it on a resumé, even if it had an "interests" section: tag groups, music of the listening variety (Ava Max, Faouzia, and Vivaldi at the moment I'm typing this, but the Spotify recommendations can and will change that in about five minutes), FYP reels, Grey's Anatomy, political comedy
- Tech stack (in roughly descending order of proficiency): Python, R (+ R Shiny), OCaml, SQL, Bash/Shell, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Perl
- Language queue (in smoothly descending order of proficiency): Standard Corporate Buzzword, Standard American English, Mandarin Chinese, Latin American Spanish, Standard Central Russian, Modern Hebrew
